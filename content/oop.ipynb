    "In other datatypes e.g. dictionaries we can hold information about entities that look very similar and have the same type of information inside. The problem is that we have the flexibility to store anything we want in a dictionary and **nobody forces us to always have the same information** (=more structured & less error prone). A further disadvantage is that these entities only hold data but can not do certain actions. Depending on the level of nested information it can also be very cumbersome to retrieve certain information from a dictionary / add a new entry to the dictionary."

    "Python offers something that allows us to define a specific structure that contains information we hold: a **class**. A class is an object and therefore has all of the object's characteristics: a name (class name), attributes (variables that belong to this object) & behaviour (functions that can be executed on this object and do something). Everything in Python is an object and we already used objects like string (name: string, attribute: text it contains, behaviour: functions like .split()) or lists (name: list, attribute: data it contains, behaviour: functions like .copy()). OOP means that we don't have to really know how those attributes and methods are defined but only need to know what we have to put in, to get a certain output.\n",

In the OOP way we usually **name the variable** with a starting `_` (meaning PRIVATE) which is simply a naming convention that asks developers not to use this variable directly (however they can) but rather use the proper method (interface).\n",
