    "**Instructions** can do everything from mathematical operations to image manipulation and are written in a certain programming language. The syntax of programming languages varies, but every language has basic instructions for **Input** (what you get from the user/another program), **storage** (store information), **output** (behaviour/show to the user/pass back to another program), **mathematics**, **conditionals** (do things only in certain situations) & **repetition** (repeat things). **In programming we break apart a large task into smaller tasks until the subtasks are so small/simple that they can be executed with these instructions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming is important** because **Computers** are everywhere (laptop, desktop, smartphone, terminals in restaurants, ...). Additionally software is eating the world: most businesses are run on software (not only movie oder video industries but also other industries). Because we rely so heavily on software, software failures (bugs) can have severe consequences going into billions of dollars in economical but also other losses and therefore it is very important to program properly. The same reliability also means that there is a strong demand for programmers and people who understand programmers and there already is a shortage of professionals."

    "ENCAPSULATION THEREFORE:\n",
    "* Protects objects from unwanted access (the data inside objects is only modified through methods that know how not to break the logic of the variable)\n",
    "* Allows Access to a level without revealing the complex details below (as a user of a class, you don’t have to know how the class is implemented, but only how to operate with it)\n",
    "* Reduces Human Error & Simplifies Maintenance & Makes Application Easier To Understand"
